    <h2>Studio</h2>
        <p>Studios are designed with sound in mind, so they are the ideal space to record in.  From large open rooms
        to small intimate spaces, every studio is different, thus producing unique recordings.</p>
    <h2>Home</h2>
        <p>If you do not have the resources to book studio time, recording in the home is an option.  You can rent
            equipment from an outside company to produce the recordings in your home.  Recording in your home allows
            you to work at your own pace as you are not being billed hourly.</p>
    <h2>Other</h2>
        <p>Any space with great acousics can be considered for recording. Large spaces such as churches, can create
            unique recordings with natural reverb.</p>

    <h2>Condenser</h2>
        <p>Condenser microphones are more sensitive and require an outside power source or battery. Condenser microphones
             have a greater frequency response and transient response.  They are more sensitive to loud sounds, but generally
             have a louder output. </p>
    <h2>Dynamic</h2>
        <p>Dynamic microphones are more durable than condenser microphones and often less expensive.
            They are able to handle louder sound pressure levels, making them ideal for loud sound sources.</p>

    <h2> Compressors</h2>
        <p>Compression helps level the loudness throughout a piece. It makes the quiter parts louder and
            louder parts quiter for a more even listen.  It can also be used as an effect to help bring forward
            a specific sound source in the mix.</p>
    <h2>Equalizers</h2>
        <p>Equalizers allow you to adjust the tone of the different elements in the recording.  Equalizers adjust the
             amplitude of a specific frequency of a sound source.</p>
    <h2>Effects</h2>
        <p>Effects such as reverb, echo, and phaser can be added to the sound sources in a recording to help add depth
            and space to the mix.</p>
